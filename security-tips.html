          <h3>Security Tips</h3>
          <p class="lead lead-normal">
            <strong>ADCB-Egypt</strong> is dedicated to ensuring that your
            accounts remain secure and your personal information remains
            private. To that end, here are some tips that will help you feel
            comfortable when you bank with us.
          </p>
          <h4>Personal Computer</h4>
          <ul>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Install all security updates offered by your software provider(s).
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Install a personal firewall on your computer.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Protect your computer against viruses and spyware by using
              anti-spyware software, anti-virus software, and automatic
              upgrades.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Scan your computer regularly for both spyware and viruses.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Avoid downloading programs from unknown sources. Some sources may
              have hidden forms of spyware or viruses that could compromise the
              security of your computer.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              You can verify secure sites by "double-clicking" on the padlock
              icon located at the bottom of your browser application and reading
              the site info in the box that appears.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">Activate a pop-up blocker.</li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Leave suspicious sites. If a website does not appear to be what
              you expected it to be, leave immediately.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              When your computer is not in use, shut it down or disconnect it
              from the Internet.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Be vigilant in your online activities. Always keep in mind that
              forging emails and creating fraudulent websites is not difficult.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Confirm the validity of all requests for sensitive personal,
              financial, or account information, particularly if they are made
              with an urgent or threatening tone.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Read and familiarize yourself with the Privacy Policies and legal
              disclosures of software providers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Email</h4>
          <ul>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Question suspicious emails. ADCB-Egypt will never send you an
              email asking for your online ID or password.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              If you receive an email that appears to be suspicious, do not
              reply to it or click on the link it provides. Simply delete it.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              If you think you may have provided personal or account information
              in response to a fraudulent email or website, report the fraud
              immediately, change your password, and monitor your account
              activity frequently.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Avoid clicking on links provided in emails. It is always better to
              type the address into your browser.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Open email attachments only if you know the sender. It is best to
              scan attachments with your anti-virus software prior to opening.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Never open email attachments that have file endings of .exe, .pif,
              or .vbs. These are file extensions for executables, and are
              commonly dangerous files.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Be careful and selective before providing your email address to a
              questionable website. Sharing your email address makes you more
              likely to receive fraudulent emails.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Online Banking</h4>
          <ul>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Monitor your account activity frequently to detect fraud earlier.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Review your monthly credit card and bank account statements
              thoroughly. Investigate suspicious items immediately to avoid any
              possible fraud before it occurs.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Avoid using Internet Cafes / Public PCs to access online banking.
              Use your home or other PC that you know follows good security
              practices.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Always log off from your Online Banking session.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Password Pin</h4>
          <ul>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Choose password and personal identification numbers (PINs) that
              are difficult for others to guess.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Use a different password for each of your online accounts.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Do not share your IDs, passwords, or PINs with anyone.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Change your passwords and PIN often.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Try not to use personal information in your passwords or PINs.
              Passwords that contain information such as your name, date of
              birth, or telephone number are not as secure as more random
              information.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Credit Card &#38; Debit Card</h4>
          <ul>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Never carry your credit /debit card personal identification number
              (PIN) with you. Memorize it, or keep the number in a safe place at
              home.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Make copies of all the card information that you carry daily and
              keep them in a secure place.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Review your monthly credit card and bank account statements
              thoroughly. Investigate suspicious items immediately and report
              any possible fraud before it occurs.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Report lost or stolen cards immediately, call 16862
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Always be sure to retrieve both your card and receipt after every
              transaction.
            </li>
            <li class="lead lead-normal">
              Protect your card from damage and avoid leaving it near magnetic
              devices or mobile telephones.
            </li>
          </ul>
